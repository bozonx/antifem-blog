Nowadays there is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence and many fear that it will destroy mankind when a strong artificial intelligence is created. There is even an opinion that mankind is an intermediate stage of evolution before the creation of super intelligence. And when it will be created, mankind will not be needed.

But for some reason no one raises the question that feminists for many years have been talking in their communities about the destruction of men to make mankind same-sex. And this is no less important a threat than artificial intelligence.

Yes, the femkas have shut everyone's mouths in the media space, but it still needs to be talked about because the destruction of men is a very serious threat to humanity. Maybe they won't destroy men by force, they will just stop giving birth to boys, so no one will even notice how men will gradually die out.

Feminists have already established birth control, they are already telling all women to decide on conception unilaterally, without asking a man even if they are married, they have already prepared the legal basis for complete birth control, they already control the information and political space, already now with IVF it is possible to choose the sex of the child, and on the way is the technology that allows lesbians to have their own children.

Just combine that with the fact that they've been talking about destroying men for years.
