Every woman claims to be a miserable laborer and no help from her husband.

Have you ever seen such families in reality? I personally have never seen one and I have asked people - no one has ever seen a family where the man lies on the couch and the wife works at home.

But in every Russian family you will see the exact opposite picture - the wife sits all day in the phone, goes to the marigolds and shopping centers, endlessly chatting with girlfriends and mom, does not cook, orders food. And the husband is working 2 jobs, gives her money and at the same time the wife constantly harnesses him to housework - to vacuum, throw out the trash, take care of the children, etc., without even letting him sit down. All this under the pretext that it is hard for her and the wife needs to help. When her husband comes home from work, she looks tired, although the only useful thing she did was to press a couple of buttons on the washing machine and dishwasher.
