Feminists marched in the center of Bishkek, there were about 1,000 people. The femmes showed misandric posters and behaved like the masters of the city and the country, the police did not react to this in any way. There were representatives of the press at the rally, in particular, correspondents of Radio Liberty, but they did not talk about the dangers of feminism and listen to the Amir's anti-feminist position. (Let me remind you that Radio Liberty is a femme LGBT organization sponsored by the American foundation Usaid). The feminists themselves also refused to answer the question of what they stand for at this rally and why they have anti-male posters.

Amir printed out a T-shirt with our logo, which he protested by wearing to a feminist march. The leader of the feminists, Gulyim Ayilchi, noticed him and slandered him to the police, lying to them that he allegedly threatened her on social networks and at this action, other femmes confirmed this (widespread femme manipulation). The police officers obeyed her without hesitation. They didn't even look into the situation and took Amir outside the park, threatening to take him to the police if he didn't leave because women were complaining about him. Obviously, in this way Gulyim Ayilchi simply got rid of the man who tells the truth about feminism, so that he would not stop her from deceiving the people of Kyrgyzstan.

Friends, I urge you to follow the example of Amir, he is a very brave man, he alone stood up to a thousand women! Write posters, print T-shirts, post flyers, gather like-minded people, and conduct propaganda activities in your city.

Stop being humiliated! Stop being oppressed! Let's throw off the shackles of slavery! We have nothing more to lose except our chains! Let's follow the example of the brave Amir and join the fight for our existence and our future! Together we will defeat the global evil!
