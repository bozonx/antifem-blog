We will talk a lot more about feminist propaganda and censorship. But I will tell you about an interesting manipulative technique, which is very typical in political and social movements, where feminists turn men into militant aliens of feminism and fight for the deprivation of men's rights and for excessive privileges of women.

Just saying that we should fight for women's rights is not enough, even making feminism fashionable is not enough, although it works great. But still it does not force men to engage in political activism, and that is what is important, it is in the political field that women are privileged and men's rights are taken away. But in order to force men to do this, in addition to deception, feminists influence their sexual desires. They create an illusion that if he will be an obedient deer, if he will fight together with them shoulder to shoulder for deprivation of his rights, then sex with a feminist is possible. And in general it seems that he will get any if she finds out that he is a feminist. 

Since the desire for sex is strong enough, the victim of manipulation puts his immediate benefit over the future, over the future of his sex, his future children and makes all the men he knows unhappy and powerless. But the funny thing is that he doesn't even get sex, because feminists have no such goal.

And this is unfortunately the most effective way of creating militant men. I saw it myself when I was a political activist in Russia. Feminists fought off fellow activists from fellow activists who knew the truth about feminism. Newly minted feminists stopped socializing with other guys, spent all their time in feminist hangouts and took part in feminist actions, even though they had originally entered politics for other purposes.
