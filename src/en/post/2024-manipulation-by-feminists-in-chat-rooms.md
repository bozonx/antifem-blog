- Feminist says this is a feminist chat room. This manipulation means they're planting their flag here, and you're not welcome here and get out. There is no way you can leave or you will give them the win. Underestimate the value of femocs in this chat, say that you are only a couple of inadequates here, the rest of the people are normal. This will also emphasize that femkas are separate from the mainstream, not one with it as they want to present, and show that you have a good attitude to the rest of the people. And then if femmes behave toxically (and they will), you can develop this theme and appeal to the rest of the audience that you are normal, you are not like them. You can also ask femmes to identify themselves to identify them and show that this is not the whole chat.
- A femme or several start behaving inappropriately, not responding adequately to messages and just freaking out. This manipulation aims to make you uncomfortable in chat so that you leave, so that you think ugh at you inadequates and leave. Don't go out. And demonstrate to everyone that this is what feminism is - ultratoxicity, inadequacy and unwarranted aggression. You need to make a connection with the gray masses that feminism is this kind of inadequate behavior. And you can also emphasize that antifems behave appropriately and speak reasonably.
- Feminist says "I'm just trolling" or I'm messing with you. That's manipulation. It's throwing out toxic comments so that you're not held accountable for your words. She wants to show that you're stupid and fell for the trolling. She's trying to make you look stupid in front of the gray masses and at the same time shut you up. If you believe that he is trolling you, you should feel uncomfortable and stop posting in chat. Don't fall for the manipulation, say that this is what people who just don't have arguments say when they know they are wrong
- Don't be aggressive yourself. For your aggression will immediately catch on and try to make you look like aggressors and inadequates, or in general they can emotionally spin you and then kick you out of the chat. And this will be their victory. Always write in such a way that it is impossible to get hooked on your words at all
- Identify aggression in your opponents and when aggression and toxicity is detected, speak about it immediately. Turn the topic to the fact that the person is aggressive and let him explain his aggression first, and only then you can continue the conversation.
- Fems tend to attack more than one at a time. The only way to do that is to do joint raids. Therefore, if you are caught tongue with femki in any chat immediately write in our chat and call for help, do not be shy
