The Internet is flooded with information about the infringement of women's rights, but it is extremely difficult to find information about the infringement of men's rights except in groups in social networks of masculists. On wikipedia and in general in authoritative publications and mass media you will hardly ever see true statistics, graphs and studies on the position of men and women in society. Why is that? It is a consequence of feminist censorship.

Everyone who works in this field knows that his feminists will shame him, cancel him and put a cross on his career if he publishes truthful information about the true situation of men. That is why scientists, psychologists and sociologists avoid working in this direction.

If you are interested in psychology, you have inevitably come across information about whether men and women are more or less likely to have mental illnesses or personality disorders such as psychopathy. It seems that all antisocial illnesses are in men, while women have illnesses caused by male tyranny.

So that's because famous psychiatrists are afraid to talk about statistics where women look worse than men. It's funny to watch them on YouTube - they'll apologize 10 times to feminists and 20 times claim they're not sexists to voice information from studies where men look better than women. But it's easy to get information where men look worse. For example, because of this it was thought for a long time that mainly men are prone to psychopathy, but according to recent studies it turned out that it occurs about equally in M and W.

The same happens in other areas - statistics on domestic violence, rights and privileges of women and men in society and legislation, female pedophilia, unequal pay. These topics are taboo in the scientific community if they make men look better than women and wives don't look victimized by men.
