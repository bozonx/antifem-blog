Artificial intelligence technologies are already changing the world. Businesses are actively reorienting towards AI, especially in the US, and this process is unstoppable, because for business owners it is simply a gold mine - AI works without weekends and breaks and costs 500 times less than a real employee.

Already now AI is being actively implemented in the IT sector, first of all in programming, but the last frontier has not been passed yet, no systems that can create large applications and make changes in them have appeared yet, but it seems that soon enough they will appear, because modern AI can already generate simple applications and websites. The work of illustrators and many photographers has become almost meaningless, the work of designers has become a mere chore.

The most popular profession for men - cab, bus and truck driver will soon be a thing of the past. Already now there are cabs with autopilot driving on the streets of San Francisco, as well as trucks with autopilot are being actively introduced. Delivery is also moving to robots and drones.

What does that mean? It means that many men will lose the opportunity to earn money, many male professions, such as programmers and drivers will become almost not in demand. But the professions of operators and those who do routine work, linking various tools and processes with AI and working with customers, will be in high demand.

This means that it will be easier for women, who today more often choose such professions, to adapt to the new conditions. So women's standard of living will only increase, and men's standard of living will decrease. And as you know, women do not consider men who do not earn millions as people, so the birth rate in progressive countries will decrease even more.

Frankly speaking, although I am a big fan of technology and science, I am not very positive about such a rapid development of AI. And men will obviously be in a less favorable position than women.
