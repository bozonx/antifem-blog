You've probably heard that Women's Day for their rights is celebrated on March 8. It seems like everything is so noble, we should be glad that women have finally received freedom and rights equal to men.

But underneath the tons of lies lies a very ugly truth that few people will tell you about.

First, let's ask ourselves a question: if women were oppressed in their opinion, does it mean that someone oppressed them? So? So. And since there are only two sexes, it means that women were oppressed by men, but for some reason this is not mentioned. I think it's obvious why: because men won't want to celebrate a holiday steeped in hatred of men and proclaiming them as oppressors and aggressors. Behind all these beautiful words about the emancipation of women lies the shaming of men, and all of them, including even pro-feminist men, who enslave themselves and other men and make their sons slaves.

Secondly, what no woman will ever tell you, even one who knows the story well: in fact, women have never been deprived of their rights relative to men, especially in Western society. On the contrary, women have had privileges over men of the same class for almost the entire history. Women have always had a safer life, their only danger in life was to die during childbirth, while men's lives were fraught with deadly dangers.; women were as close to supplies as possible - this was the most privileged place in the conditions of food shortages that had accompanied humanity for almost all of history; even before the law, women had privileges, for example, punishments for peasant women were more lenient than for peasant men for the same crimes.

What was really severely punished for was cheating on her husband, and that's exactly what feminists put forward as a violation of women, but the question is, what's the problem with not cheating? It is for the opportunity to fuck that women have always fought, and now they have achieved victory - cheating has become not just the norm, but also the meaning of most women's lives.

It can be said for sure that during the time of patriarchy there was no gender oppression within one class, but only class oppression, which is what Karl Marx wrote about. The most important thing to understand is that women of a lower class were NOT oppressed by MEN, BUT by OTHER WOMEN from a higher class. It's a secret that no feminist will tell you.

What is the trick on March 8: to substitute concepts and hide the truth. If we celebrate something with the words “independence” and “freedom”, then it is definitely perceived positively by society and no one will even think about what is really hidden under these beautiful words. Secondly, by celebrating the victory of women, we unknowingly admit the defeat of men, despite the fact that men are not even aware that a war of extermination and enslavement has been waged against them.

By celebrating March 8, you recognize all the feminist lies, you recognize yourself as aggressors, oppressors, enemies of women, and you accuse yourself of something that neither you nor your male ancestors committed. By celebrating March 8, you are helping feminists hide the truth that there has never been any intra-class oppression of women in history, that the oppressors of women were not men, but women themselves, that women have always had privileges over men within the same class. By celebrating this day, you are making men slaves and giving women the right to be enslavers of men.

March 8 is the day of the enslavement of men. Look what's going on: men are running after flowers and gifts, trying to please their mistress, and the gift should be expensive, not those beggarly socks that women give men on men's day. Also, many men take on all the responsibilities of a wife for the whole holiday, humoring her in every possible way and taking her to expensive restaurants, while not getting anything in return. Women don't do anything like that on men's day.

March 8 is literally the day of the worship of the vagina, the enslavement of men, and the day of the triumph of blasphemy and femofascism.
