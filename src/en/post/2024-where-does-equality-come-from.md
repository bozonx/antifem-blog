It's not easy to understand this in a large state, but let's narrow society down to 10 people - 5 men and 5 women, say living on a desert island.

If 5 women refuse to work, but continue to consume the same amount of resources as men, then 5 men will have to work 2 times more to provide food and everything they need. Accordingly, those who contribute more to society get more rights. This was the case under patriarchy - men worked mostly, and they also had more rights.

But now feminists have created a matriarchy and with the help of propaganda and brainwashing have managed to achieve a situation where women work less than men, work at easier, safer and irresponsible jobs and at the same time receive equal or higher (in the West) pay than men, have disproportionately more rights and privileges than men who work at more dangerous, difficult and responsible jobs and contribute much more to the creation of public goods.

## What are anti-feminists fighting for?

We are for equality, which means that every member of society not only has equal rights, but also equal responsibilities and contributes equally to society. This is where equal rights come from - if a man and a woman make equal contributions, then they are in a position to demand equal rights in society. If on a desert island all 10 men and women participate in the creation of wealth, they are obliged to have equal rights.

And what we see now in society is called slavery. Project the current situation onto a small society of 10 people and you will see that men are slaves of women, often lacking even the most basic rights.
