Feminists and feminists are very fond of manipulation, when someone speaks negatively about feminism, that supposedly there are different currents of feminism: yes there is radical feminism, it's bad, but here's ordinary feminism is good, it's for women's rights.

In fact, in modern feminism there are no clearly defined currents. Modern feminism is very integral. Yes, there are radical feminists, but they differ from ordinary feminists only in that they want to destroy men, and ordinary feminists only want to enslave them. By and large this is the only difference, in all other respects these currents are almost identical, moreover it is the same feminism.

The purpose of this manipulation is to whitewash feminism and make your opinion of it favorable or even make you a feminist.

- It uses heightened contrast - those are really bad and we are very good against them
- Recognizing that there is a bad feminism puts your guard down, it seems that the feminist thinks reasonably, that she understands the issue, that there is supposedly some opposition in feminism and there are those who have made the right choice. By the way, this technique is often used in politics, this lie is very difficult to recognize because it looks like reality.
- It's also a way to get the interlocutor to agree with you - you're not wrong that there is bad feminism, just not all feminism is bad.
- It also makes sure to point out that there are few bad feminists and a lot of good feminists. It's an influence on the herd instinct - the majority can't be wrong and one is more likely to join the majority. (In fact, there are a lot of rad femos and their number is increasing progressively).
- Plus each person considers himself good and will join the good ones rather than the bad ones.
- It also affects pride - like you will be a hero who fights for righteous causes, you will be recognized and respected. Here they demonstrate how they respect some famous feminist or feminist guy from their party.
