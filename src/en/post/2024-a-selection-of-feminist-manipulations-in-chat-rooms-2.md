1. As a particularly insane manipulation - femmes equate feminism with everything good that civilization has created, with civilization itself, that feminism is a world without wars, violence and hatred, and those who dare to criticize it oppose such a prosperous world and want to destroy it. Obviously the goal here is not only to demonstrate that feminism = all the best that civilization has achieved, but also to get other people to defend feminism by defending the benefits of civilization
2. Men are endless wars, violence and hatred. Who starts the wars? Wives? No, men. Women have never started wars (actually they haven't, for example Russian czaristas have started wars more often than men during the same period of rule). So they want to shift the focus from the problems you're talking about to the fact that it's men who are the problem, all the bad things are from them. They also support the stereotype that women are love and kindness, and men are aggression without reason and wars
3. If feminism puts forward ideas of equal rights for women to get education and work, then you are against it. This is a double-bottom manipulation, it is based on the initially false claim that feminism is for equality and then they already reason on the basis of this claim and lead to the fact that you are against equality and women's basic rights.
4. Feminists create the illusion that all men want women to have less rights and females are so heroic, fighting for their rights in this unfair world of men and trying to get some rights, is that bad? By doing this they hide from people that in reality the world is completely different - women have much more rights and privileges than men and want to get even more, and men often don't even have basic rights. But feminists don't think of giving up, they want to take away men's rights altogether
