I, as a representative of the millennial generation, will tell you about the attitude to boys and girls in schools during the 90s and 2000s in Russia.

Female staff of schools, especially teachers of 30+ years were imbued with dislike for men, they, their failures with men, caused by excessive demands to them, projected on the attitude to male students. And male teachers were arrogant and disrespectful of boys and allowed themselves to use harsher punishments and remarks against them, while overprotecting girls.

Boys were humiliated in front of the whole class for common childish pranks - forced to go to the blackboard where the teacher reprimanded and ridiculed him. Girls were never treated in this way, although they were no less mischievous.

Sometimes public works were required for the school, for which only boys were employed, although they could be done by girls as well. The exploitation of boys was sometimes absurd. For example, in my case, the labor officer even sent us to steal boards from a construction site and collect bolts and nuts scattered around the service station.

Labor lessons for girls were interesting - they sewed and cooked, but for boys it was some kind of idiocy - they made wedges of wood and mallets, even stools were not made.

In conflicts between a boy and a girl they never sorted out who was right and who was guilty - the boy was always guilty and he had to apologize to the girl even if it was her fault.

Teachers did not react in any way to bullying if it concerned boys. But at the same time they always intervened if they saw the teacher being bullied.

I wonder if things have changed in today's schools. I heard that nowadays children are no longer harnessed for community service and bullying among girls has become tougher than among boys.
