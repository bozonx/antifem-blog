Manipulations used by feminists in chat rooms to keep other people from knowing the truth.

1. The most common manipulation is to speak from the position of normality, like they are normal and do the right thing, and you are some fools who don't like something, misunderstood something or offended women. The goal here is to prevent others from waking up, so that other people do not take the information from these "fools" seriously. The second goal is to give all the people watching the argument the feeling that they are part of the normal, right and good, and the normal ones are of course feminists.
2. Demonstrate that you are just a paranoid person who thinks the world is so terrible and laugh at the fact that the person has made up his own mind and created his own problems. For example, the phrase "how do you survive in this world, there are evil women everywhere".
3. To turn the idea of anti-feminism and any criticism of feminism into the fact that you were just offended by a woman and now you just hate women and that's why you say so. This is to hide the truth from other people so people don't think about the disempowerment of men and the insane privileges of women. Like, there's no such thing, it's just some dumbasses talking about women because they've been wronged.
4. Equate anti-feminism to ultra traditionalism or to the ultra right-wing patriarchal movement Male State (banned in Russia). People not versed in the issue will easily believe this, because feminists in the media space have managed to convince the public that any criticism of feminism comes from such movements, and therefore one word is enough and you can easily be labeled a stupid skufa, imagining himself a patriarchal.
5. Therefore, if you are against feminism (so like ultra patriarchal), you are against women driving or getting an education. So you are against normal women's rights, which is supported by the whole progressive society.
