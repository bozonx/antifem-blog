Because women have traded having children for material benefits. However, scientists are afraid to name the reason for fear that feminists will deprive them of their careers, but I will, I'm not afraid.

Feminists have indoctrinated women with the idea of taking birth control and trading childbearing for material goods and power over men and all of humanity.

So women have created [vaginocapitalism](https://youtu.be/CKHKRFvwu4k) and exchange access to their vagina for money and goods, while having children is not profitable for them because they may lose this cornucopia. Hence the low birth rates in countries that are overrun by feminism, and where there is feminism, there is vaginocapitalism and other female ideologies, which are essentially all white countries.

Slavic women, for example, have the trade in their vagina to the point of complete absurdity. Women, as if, say to men: if you want your nation not to die out, pay, you need to, and I can easily find a Turk or an Arab.
