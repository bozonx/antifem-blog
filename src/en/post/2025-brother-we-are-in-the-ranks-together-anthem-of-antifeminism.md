Brother, we are in the ranks together.,  
For the rights of men, for their freedom!  
We will not be silent, we will not tolerate,  
Our voice sounds, we will sing!

Chorus:
For men, for rights, for honor and dreams,  
We stand together, we are not alone!  
The sun is shining on us, leading us forward,  
Antifemenism is our proud people!
Let's say "no" to all stereotypes,

We are not toys, we are not victims of insults!  
Strength is in unity, in truth, and in the word.,  
We will fight, we will fight!

When we are squeezed, when we are crushed,  
Let's gather all our strength and march boldly!  
We are not weak, we are strong in spirit.,  
Let's forget about fear and move forward!

Those who can't hear us, let them learn again.,  
That a man's destiny is also love!  
United forever, shoulder to shoulder,  
And together we can, because we are not one!

Chorus:  
For men, for rights, for honor and dreams,  
We stand together, we are not alone!  
The sun is shining on us, leading us forward,  
Antifemenism is our proud people!
For men, for rights, for honor and dreams,  
We stand together, we are not alone!  
The sun is shining on us, leading us forward,  
Antifemenism is our proud people!

We will tell everyone that we will not back down.,  
Please, brother, we will not be conquered!  
We walk boldly, we live with dignity
For the rights of men, we are going all over the world!
