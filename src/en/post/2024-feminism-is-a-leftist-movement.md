Even though almost all leftists are feminists it doesn't mean that feminism is a leftist movement. Marxism, left liberalism and anarchism were not originally feminist, moreover they were patriarchal. But gradually feminists squeezed all the masculists out of these movements and took over.

And now, of course, the femmes claim that these are their movements so that masculists do not even approach them and to impose feminism on everyone who comes to liberal and anarchist chat rooms. Because of this, many masculists had to leave to right-wing movements after the victory of feminism. But that's a mistake - that's what the femmes need, to get us to stop fighting for leftist political platforms and give them to feminists.

So feminism is not a left-wing movement. What is it then? Definitely right-wing, and here's why:

1. First of all, feminism seeks to establish matriarchy. And matriarchy, like patriarchy, belongs to the right-wing political spectrum.
2. Secondly, the idea of dominance of a group of people by birthright is exactly the same as monarchy or the superiority of one nation or race over another. And the superiority of women by birthright over men and the slavery of men by birthright cannot be a leftist ideology, because leftist ideologies advocate the equality of all people. And class stratification is strictly a right-wing ideology
3. Modern feminism is a near-fascist ideology. Feminists claim that women are the superior and perfect sex, and men are a dead end appendage, an evolutionary error or at best an evolutionary step that has already been passed to make humanity same-sex. And don't be fooled by the fact that these are the ideas of only radical feminism, all modern feminism to a greater or lesser degree promotes the idea of the superiority of women. And since fascism is definitely a right-wing ideology, feminism is also a right-wing ideology.

So friends, don't let it fool you when someone claims that feminism is purely leftist. Modern feminism is more properly called femino-fascism.
