In arguments with feminists, you can easily spot their typical strategy of distorting the world - strongly emphasizing facts that are favorable to them, shouting about them directly, while glossing over other unfavorable ones.

Also, they often ignore the common phenomenon and emphasize the rare, for example, they present the facts about violence committed by men against women as if it is something widespread, although objectively it is a rare phenomenon.

They do all this so that gullible people will believe their lies and side with them. It is especially valuable to them that men become feminists and start actively fighting for the deprivation of their rights.

## Examples of their lies

- Feminists claim that women are weak and therefore do not commit domestic violence. What they don't say is that they are more than strong enough to use a knife or a frying pan, which they often do. If a man is more likely to strike with his fist, a woman is more likely to strike with a knife, and it ends much worse. But that's not what the fems won't tell you. 
- Feminists scream about being paid less than men at work. But they hide the fact that they actually demand that women working in easier and more irresponsible jobs get paid the same as men working in harder and more responsible jobs
- Feminists scream rape and try to make all men look like potential rapists and overly force the issue of women's "safety" by demanding [separate spaces](https://t.me/antifem_battle/204), parking lots, subway cars, etc. for women. What they don't say is that they need this so they can shut down any man they don't like on false rape charges and gain power over men. And they especially don't say that there are objectively not as many rapes as they try to show. And are completely silent about the rape of men, particularly boys, by women. 
- Femmes scream about [harassment](https://t.me/antifem_battle/220) by men, but they will never tell you about harassment by women against men, which is also there. Furthermore, you won't even find such statistics because men can't go to the police about it. 
- They scream about how abortion should not be banned. But they ignore the fact that a man in an official marriage has no right to decide whether or not to keep a child alive. Feminists give women the exclusive right to kill babies. When a man says that he wants to have the right to keep his child alive, they shift the topic to abortion after rape, as if men are fighting for depriving women of the right to abortion after rape. Although objectively no one is against such abortions.
