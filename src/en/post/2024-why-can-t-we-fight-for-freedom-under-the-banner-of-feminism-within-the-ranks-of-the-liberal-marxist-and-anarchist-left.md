Because that does't make sense - becoming free of autocrats and capitalism, but becoming a slave to the dictatorship of feminism.

Male feminists think they're fighting for freedom, but they're just fighting to bring feminists who are parasitic on leftist movements to power. Once in power, the feminists will make those same men their slaves, because the enemy of feminists is unchanging - men and whether he helped establish the matriarchy and dictatorship of feminism or not, he will be just as enslaved as other men.

For feminists, any man who believes their propaganda, especially a male feminist, is just a convenient tool for seizing power. There will be no gratitude from feminists, as they consider him a fool who fell for manipulation. There will be no respect either, since a man fighting for the deprivation of rights of himself and the gender to which he belongs does not arouse respect from feminists.

Therefore it is necessary to cleanse the ranks of liberals, Marxists and anarchists from feminism, or to create separate pure movements that fight for true freedom, freedom not only from dictatorship and capitalism, but also from femino-fascism, only then it is possible to find freedom in society.
