Feminism has infiltrated and parasitized many social and political organizations, replacing their goals with feminist ones. This is especially evident in politics, especially in left-wing political platforms, but there are also many feminists on the right.

Having taken over political platforms, feminists stifle all initiatives that do not pass under the banner of feminism and force those initiatives that promote feminism. So from the outside it seems that, for example, all leftists are feminists, but in fact no political platform is linked to feminism. It's just that the femcists have taken over these platforms and forced out of them all dissenters, all those who want equality and harmony in society, and substitute the goals of the captured political platforms with discrimination against men and giving women excessive privileges.

Feminism has also taken over many social movements, such as LGBT (banned in Russia), which is completely controlled by radical feminists to lesbians, as well as the feminists have taken over environmental movements and forced normal people out of them.

The fact that they have taken them over does not mean that we should give up our positions without a fight and leave these movements. It is necessary to fight and oust feminism from the socio-political space. This is why our project was created, share this information, participate in the fight against the world evil - global feminism.
