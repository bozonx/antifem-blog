1. To hide their true intentions. Equality seems like something good and progressive, while inequality seems bad and backward. That's why femmes put an equal sign between feminism and equality to hide the fact that they are actually in favor of discriminating against men
2. To make people feel like they are doing something important and honorable. People will be more eager to fight for the disenfranchisement of men if they think it's a noble cause
3. that the struggle for women's dominance never stops. If people think that women are constantly disadvantaged and men have excessive rights, then everyone will fight to give women more and more rights and privileges and to deprive men of even the most basic rights and it will never stop. Note that equal rights of the sexes in many countries were achieved in the first half of the 20th century, but feminism has not gone anywhere, and right now it is gaining momentum and has become the largest social and political organization in the world.
4. To engage men. While most women understand perfectly well what kind of "equality" feminism is talking about - privileges and rights for women, and duties and responsibilities for men - men take really equal rights for equality. And if men are indoctrinated that equality is when women have rights and not men, then men will fight to deprive themselves of rights even if they themselves do not have the most basic rights, which is what is happening now.
5. To make excessive rights for women and lack of basic rights for men the norm. Then people will not only fight for it, but will oppose those who want true equality.
