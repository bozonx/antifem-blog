For us, of course, the lies of feminism are obvious, because their claims are easily shattered by basic logic. In the same way, I think some feminists realize that they are lying, but they do it to gain exclusive privileges in society, so for them it is a lie for their benefit (only their benefit of course).

But surprisingly, male feminists promote feminism that fights to take away their rights and they don't question feminism. For example, I was once talking to a feminist in a chat room and he asked me to give an example of where men are disadvantaged. I gave the most obvious example - different retirement age in Russia. But interestingly enough, he just couldn't understand what the problem was that women retire earlier than men while living 10 years longer than men. He seemed to have a blocked understanding of it in his head, even though it is a well-known fact.

But the most striking thing was in communication with a Ukrainian anarcho-feminist. The man could not understand the inequality of the fact that men die in the trenches, they are forbidden to leave the country, military officers hunt for them in basements, and Ukrainian women live such a European life, go abroad to fuck and no one forces them to do anything. Just think about it: a man, who is in Ukraine, flinches at every rustle in the stairwell and confidently argues in a chat room that there is no inequality here. And as proof of equality he cited the fact that a small percentage of women work in the army in accounting and similar non-dangerous professions.

And I was only talking about the most obvious things where you can't manipulate facts and statistics like feminists do with respect to men's rights to children, domestic violence, harassment, rape and so on.
