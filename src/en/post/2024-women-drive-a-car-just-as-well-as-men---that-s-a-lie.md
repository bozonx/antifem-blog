Feminists argue that angry men spread stereotypes about women's unsafe driving.

The femoc manipulation is very simple - to shift the blame to men. That is, the problem is not that women drive irresponsibly, brazenly and dangerously, but that it is simply that men have slandered them. It also whitewashes women and allows them to continue to behave irresponsibly. And of course they vilify men by making them out to be stupid sexists who sleep and see just to denigrate women.

By the way, where does this irresponsibility of women on the road come from? And from what a woman knows: all problems will be solved by her personal slave - will fix the car she wrecks, will communicate with victims, police and hire a lawyer. All the stress and problems will be solved by her personal slave, and she will continue to behave in the same irresponsible way and conclude that it works, it is necessary to continue in the same spirit.
