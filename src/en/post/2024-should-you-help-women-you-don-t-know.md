Since childhood, men have been brought up with a false sense of nobility - it is noble to help a woman even without understanding the conflict, and if the conflict is with a man, the man is to blame by default, not her. You should drop all your affairs and rush to help a woman as soon as she demonstrates her predicament, even if she doesn't necessarily ask for it explicitly, but cries, screams or stigmatizes some man.

So nowadays women do not want to be helped - they claim that they are strong and independent and do not need men's help. And if a man helps her, he will be accused of sexual harassment, not rewarded with a sense of accomplished duty to women. So you have to get rid of all that "noble" nonsense that women put into our heads. Not because you're so selfish, but because women don't need help.

Remember that helping a woman will either cause problems for you or for an innocent man.

- If you see a woman arguing loudly with a man, shouting to attract attention, it is not because he attacked her, but because she attacked him and uses the attention to suppress his resistance
- If a woman falls down in a public place, don't help her because she will accuse you of harassment or rape, especially if you are in Western Europe. In Russia feminists also actively promote this hysteria with harassment.
- If you are dragged by a woman into her conflict with a man, it is almost certainly a conflict she created herself and is telling you that she is an innocent angel and the man is a villain and you should help her. If you help her, you are doing an evil deed, not a good one

Remember that in conflicts no woman will tell you the truth, and most conflicts with men are provoked by women themselves and there is no nobility in helping a villain to fight his victim.

And how to act? For example, in the West, if they see a fight between M and W, they just call the cops, let them deal with it. Just do not stigmatize the man when describing the incident, be as objective as possible.
