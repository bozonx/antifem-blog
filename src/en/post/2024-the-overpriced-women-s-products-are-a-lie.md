The essence of manipulation is to show that women suffer from allegedly inflated prices, that evil men are conspiring and profiteering on unhappy women, and of course to demonstrate that men are in a more favorable position and it is necessary to fight for women's rights. It is also a way to reduce the already low prices for women's goods and services to make women's lives even more comfortable, of course at the expense of men.

The bloggers claim that a haircut at a beauty salon costs $300. But they compare a haircut in a premium beauty salon with a regular haircut in a regular men's barbershop. Obviously, the comparison is obviously manipulative, because it should be compared to barbershops, where prices for a haircut are roughly equal to women's beauty salons. And in regular barbershops prices are also equal for men and women. (Obviously the price of $300 is obviously inflated intentionally to produce a greater effect).
