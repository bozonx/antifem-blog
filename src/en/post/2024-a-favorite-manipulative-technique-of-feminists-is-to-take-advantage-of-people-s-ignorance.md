The most popular manipulation is to claim that women are disadvantaged, there is a strict patriarchy, and women have no rights. Since there is strong feminist propaganda and censorship, people are usually unaware of the true state of affairs in society and, as a result of their ignorance, they believe feminists, joining the fight for women's rights, but in fact for the deprivation of men's rights and unjustified privileges for women.

Another interesting example: feminists claim that only men are terrorists. Young people may not know, since there have been no terrorist attacks in Russia before Crocus, but previously women suicide bombers, [black widows](https://cyclowiki.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8B_(%D0%A0%D0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F), participated in terrorist attacks).

Feminists also claim that women are in hell of a lot of pain during childbirth and therefore men owe them. But in fact, during labor, endorphins are released and the woman is in a state of euphoria. If there were no this reward mechanism in the human brain, no one would give birth, much less agree to second and subsequent births. Yes, there are difficult births, it's a separate case, but normal labor is quite a regular procedure - 3 days in the maternity home and home.

Also females often claim that under patriarchy in Muslim countries a man has 4 wives and beats them all the time. In fact, only very rich men have more than one wife, because for a woman you have to pay a very large ransom and then provide for her, so the vast majority of men have one wife. Secondly, Muslims have very severe punishment for beating a wife, so domestic violence is very rare. But since many people don't know this, they easily believe feminists.
