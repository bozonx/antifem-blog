Have you ever thought about the fact that everyone is outraged about various, sometimes invented infringements, but for some reason no one talks about the infringement of ordinary men - the most disenfranchised part of society, and in Western society the most disenfranchised are white heterosexual men.

Everyone is talking about their self-identity, but for some reason no one cares that men have been replaced with weak, weak-willed and feminine identities, and women have been replaced with feminine identities and masculine identities.

Everyone fights for equality, but in fact it often means taking away rights from the most vulnerable part of society - ordinary men.

The whole world enthusiastically establishes the dictatorship of feminism, but no one cares that feminism inspires hatred towards half of humanity - towards all men, and it makes women embittered, toxic, incapable of building trusting relationships and endows them with a lot of personal and psychological problems due to the inconsistency of women's nature to the image that feminists impose on them.
